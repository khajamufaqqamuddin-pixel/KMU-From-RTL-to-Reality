# üîç Observations from GTKWave Simulation (`dump.vcd`)

## ‚úÖ Overview
The simulation was executed using the testbench `vsdbabysoc_tb` and analyzed in **GTKWave** over a duration of **85 ¬µs**. The waveform data provides insights into the behavior of a simple SoC or PLL-based design. Below is a summary of the key signals observed.

---

## üìà Signal Observations

### 1. `reset` (reg)
- Remained **low (0)** throughout the simulation.
- Indicates that no reset was applied during this time window.
- All modules were active from the beginning of the simulation.

### 2. `ENb_CP` and `ENb_VCO` (reg)
- Both are active-low enable signals (`ENb_` implies active-low).
- Remained **low**, which means both **charge pump** and **VCO** blocks were **enabled**.

### 3. `REF` (reg)
- A periodic digital signal (square wave).
- Functions as the **reference input** clock, likely for a PLL.

### 4. `VCO_IN` (reg)
- Another periodic digital signal, similar to `REF`.
- Frequency closely matches that of `REF`, suggesting that the **PLL is locked** or tracking the reference.

### 5. `OUT` (real)
- A real-valued analog signal, possibly representing the output of the charge pump or filtered VCO signal.
- Shows expected continuous variation, reflecting dynamic analog behavior.

### 6. `VREFH` and `VREFL` (real)
- Constant reference voltages:
  - `VREFH ‚âà 3.3V`
  - `VREFL ‚âà 0V`
- These likely serve as high/low reference levels for analog comparison.

---

## üìå Summary

- All modules remained active since the reset signal was never asserted.
- The system appears to be stable and functional.
- The PLL subsystem seems to be **locked**, as `REF` and `VCO_IN` are synchronized.
- Analog output (`OUT`) is behaving as expected.
- Reference voltages (`VREFH`, `VREFL`) are within normal operating range.
